LIABILITY
Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the

1929 or Hague Protocol, 1955 or Montreal Convention,1999 may be applicable to the entire
journey, including any portion entirely within the country of origin or destination. For
passengers on a journey to, or from, or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of
America, the Convention and special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide
that the liability of certain carriers parties to such special contracts, for death of or personal
injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed U.S.$75,000 per
passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of
the Carrier. The names of carriers parties to such special contracts are available at all ticket
offices of such carriers and may be examined on request. Additional protection can usually be
obtained by purchasing insurance from a private Company. Such insurance is not affected by
any limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention, 1929 Hague Protocol,
1955 or Montreal Convention, 1999 or such special contracts of carriage. For further information
please consult your Airline or Insurance Company Representative. NOTE: The limit of liability
of U.S.$75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs, except that in case of a claim brought
in a State where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be
the sum of U.S.$58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.
14. ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS TRAVELLING ON AIRINDIA
ON LIMITS OF LIABILITY
If during the course of any International Carriage, Air-India as actual carrier is liable for death,
wounding or other bodily injury of any passenger, the limits of liability of Air India in each
case of death, wounding or other bodily injury shall be for proven damages upto 1,00,000 SDR,
